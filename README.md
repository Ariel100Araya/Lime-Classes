# Lime-Classes
A Ariel Araya project


Hello Everyone! Welcome to the Lime Classes reposotory! The point of the project is to make a better/more simple version of modern day learning management systems (Like Schoology, Google Classroom, Powerschool, and Microsoft Teams). This project is still in development so expect bugs! 

Update 1.0: Welcome! Added links to all needed sites and gathering sources for the first pre-canary beta.

If you would like to support the development of this service, want to become a tester, or want to help develop, please e-mail me at ariel100araya@outlook.com. I will be happy to assist you!
